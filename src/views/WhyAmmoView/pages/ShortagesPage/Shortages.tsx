            In the three months leading up to the last four US presidential
            elections, the retail price of popular civilian ammo shot up over
            100%. In fact, in the 60 days leading up to President Bidenâ€™s
            inauguration, the price increased over 300%.

            Historical data shows that the primary drivers of ammo demand and
            ammo pricing is fear (both real and unsubstantiated) and
            geo-political events.Global events, local elections, civil
            polarization, 2nd amendment rhetoric, and uncertainty have and will
            continue to directly influence ammo prices. The USAE is a simple,
            safe, and reliable way to take advantage of this opportunity.
